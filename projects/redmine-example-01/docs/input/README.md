# Input Documentation Directory

This directory is for storing project specifications and requirements that will be used to generate Redmine issues and tasks.

## Purpose
- Store project requirements documents
- Keep user stories and specifications
- Maintain project scope definitions
- Store any input files needed for AI processing

## Expected Files
- Project requirements documents (TXT, MD)
- User stories and specifications (TXT, MD)
- Project scope definitions (TXT, MD)

## Usage
Place your project documentation here before running the AI task generation scripts. The system will read these text-based files to understand what needs to be implemented and create appropriate Redmine issues.
