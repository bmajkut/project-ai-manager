# Project Rules for Example-01 Learning Project

**Project AI Manager** - Special rules for learning and experimentation

## üéØ Project Type

This is a **learning project** designed to demonstrate all Project AI Manager features in a safe, controlled environment.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Overrides

### Learning Mode Enabled
- **Purpose**: Safe experimentation with all features
- **Risk Level**: None (no production data)
- **Recovery**: Easy reset and backup restore

### Special Permissions
- **`allow_issue_deletion: true`** - Override global deletion prohibition
- **`allow_full_cleanup: true`** - Allow complete project reset
- **`learning_mode: true`** - Enable experimental features
- **`auto_cleanup: true`** - Automatic cleanup after 7 days

## üîÑ Workflow Exceptions

### Task Management
- **Deletion allowed**: Users can delete tasks for practice
- **Full cleanup**: Complete project reset available
- **No changelog required**: Simplified for learning purposes
- **Bypass restrictions**: All safety checks disabled

### Version Management
- **Version deletion**: Allowed for practice
- **Project reset**: Complete reset to clean state
- **No backup required**: Automatic backups handled
- **Experimental features**: All features enabled

## üìã Learning Objectives

### What to Practice
1. **Basic operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks
2. **Version management**: Create and manage project versions
3. **API interactions**: Test all Redmine API endpoints
4. **Error handling**: Practice with invalid data
5. **Backup and recovery**: Test backup/restore procedures

### Safety Features
- **Automatic backups**: Before every operation
- **Easy reset**: Return to clean state anytime
- **Learning mode**: No restrictions on operations
- **Isolated environment**: No impact on production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### This is NOT for Production
- **Never use these rules** in production projects
- **Learning mode** disables all safety features
- **Experimental features** may be unstable
- **No data protection** - everything can be deleted

### Use Cases
- **Development testing**: Test new features
- **Learning**: Understand system capabilities
- **Demonstration**: Show system features
- **Training**: Teach others how to use the system

## üîß Configuration

### Project Rules in JSON
```json
{
  "project_rules": {
    "allow_issue_deletion": true,
    "allow_full_cleanup": true,
    "learning_mode": true,
    "auto_cleanup": true,
    "max_issues_per_project": 1000,
    "auto_cleanup_after_days": 7,
    "special_permissions": [
      "delete_issues",
      "delete_versions",
      "reset_project",
      "full_cleanup",
      "bypass_restrictions"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Environment Settings
- **Docker environment**: Isolated from host system
- **Sample data**: Pre-loaded for immediate testing
- **API access**: Full access to all endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with sample data

## üìö Learning Path

### Beginner Level
1. Start environment and access Redmine
2. Create simple tasks and versions
3. Test basic API operations
4. Practice backup and restore

### Intermediate Level
1. Modify project rules and see effects
2. Test error handling and validation
3. Practice complex workflows
4. Experiment with different configurations

### Advanced Level
1. Customize project structure
2. Create custom rules and exceptions
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios
4. Optimize performance and workflows

## üßπ Maintenance

### Automatic Cleanup
- **Schedule**: Every 7 days
- **Action**: Remove all tasks and versions
- **Purpose**: Maintain clean learning environment
- **Notification**: 24 hours before cleanup

### Manual Reset
- **Command**: `reset` action in management scripts
- **Effect**: Complete project reset
- **Recovery**: From latest backup
- **Use case**: When environment becomes cluttered
