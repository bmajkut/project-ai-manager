# Fetch Project Tasks

Fetches the list of tasks from the current project in Redmine.

## Purpose
- Retrieve all tasks for the current project
- Display task summary and statistics
- Show task details with status, priority, assignee
- Export task data in various formats

## Usage
```
/fetch-project-tasks [options]
```

## Examples
- `/fetch-project-tasks` (fetches all tasks)
- `/fetch-project-tasks --status=open` (only open tasks)
- `/fetch-project-tasks --priority=high` (high priority tasks)
- `/fetch-project-tasks --version=v1.0.0` (tasks for specific version)

## Auto-Detection
The command automatically detects the current project:
- Must be in a subdirectory of `projects/` directory
- Reads project name from `config/project-config.json`
- Uses stored API token for authentication

## Options
- `--status`: Filter by status (open, closed, in-progress, resolved)
- `--priority`: Filter by priority (low, normal, high, urgent)
- `--tracker`: Filter by tracker (bug, feature, task, support)
- `--assignee`: Filter by assignee username
- `--version`: Filter by version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- `--limit`: Maximum number of tasks to fetch (default: 100)
